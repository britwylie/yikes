Brittany initialized Player, wrote the function getMoves that gets a vector of
all the possible moves for a given side, wrote the heuristic function, and wrote
the recursiveMiniMax function.

Tegan modified the heuristic by making it account for mobility, wrote the
miniMax function, and attempted to write the recursiveMiniMax function (this
didn't work though, so Brittany rewrote it). Tegan also wrote the negaMax
function, but this ended up not being used.
