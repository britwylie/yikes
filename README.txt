Brittany initialized Player, wrote the function getMoves that gets a vector of
all the possible moves for a given side, wrote the heuristic function, and wrote
the recursiveMiniMax function.

Tegan modified the heuristic by making it account for mobility, wrote the
miniMax function, and worked a bit on the recursiveMiniMax function. Tegan also
helped make the heuristic better.

To make our bot tournament-worthy, we made miniMax recursive to depth 4. We also
improved the heuristic by accounting for mobility and frontier squares.
